## GREEN CHAIN
GREEN CHAIN is based on the POA (Proof of Authority) algorithm, which is formulated as the POA algorithm because it can confirm transactions and transmit more data through the blockchain more quickly, providing a better practice and use of related applications in the future.

## Coding:
Based on the POA (Proof of Authority) algorithm and compatible with the very famous and stable blockchain Ethereum (POW algorithm and POS algorithm), this will enable the environmental protection chain to realize multi-chain and multi-currency transmission with more room for expansion.

Go Ethereum is a modification of Ethereum technology from POW to POS, compatibility with it makes our protocol more advantageous, the address format looks similar to Ethereum, but we are completely different and independent blockchains. We will also make more expansions in the future to be compatible with more different blockchains, making GREEN CHAIN an independent but multi-chain compatible public chain system.
